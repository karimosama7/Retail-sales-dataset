## Overview

This script performs the following tasks:

1. **Imports and Prepares Data**: Loads and prepares the retail sales dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into the dataset's structure and summary statistics.
3. **Visualizations**: Generates various plots to understand product categories, sales trends, and other key metrics.
4. **Filtering and Analysis**: Identifies the highest sales and prices, and visualizes the results.

## Installation

To run this analysis, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd repository
    ```

3. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python retail_sales_analysis.py
    ```

   Ensure that the dataset (`retail_sales_dataset.csv`) is located in the `/kaggle/input/retail-sales-dataset/` directory or update the script with the correct path.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:

- `Transaction ID`: Unique identifier for each transaction
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Quantity`: Quantity of items purchased
- `Price per Unit`: Price of a single unit
- `Total Amount`: Total amount spent
- `Product Category`: Category of the product
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Date`: Date of the transaction

## Analysis

### 1. Data Exploration

- **Initial Data Exploration**: Includes the first few rows, summary statistics, and data types.
- **Missing Values**: Checks for any missing values in the dataset.

### 2. Product Analysis

- **Product Categories**: Analyzes the distribution of product categories and visualizes the counts.
- **Sales by Product**: Compares total sales by product category and gender.

### 3. Sales Trends

- **Monthly Sales Trend**: Visualizes sales trends over different months.
- **High Sales & Prices**: Identifies transactions with the highest prices and quantities.

### 4. Visualization

- Various visualizations are provided including bar plots, pie charts, and line plots to illustrate key findings.

## Results

The script provides insights into:

- The distribution of product categories.
- Sales trends over time.
- Products with the highest sales and prices.
